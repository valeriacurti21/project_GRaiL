This is a personal project created for a futuristic TTRPG campaign of "Not The End" called "Knights of the Round Academy". Let me tell you what it is!

# Knights of the Round Academy

Welcome to the Knights of the Round Academy project! ðŸŽ‰

This project is a labor of love from a newbie web designer who fell in love with TTRPGs (Tabletop Role-Playing Games) ever since the day I tried Dungeons & Dragons with friends. Today, these games are my greatest source of inspiration for writing and creating.

# About the Campaign

"Knights of the Round Academy" is a GDR created by Fumble GDR, and it holds a special place in my heart. It was our first dive into a futuristic scenario, where the world is full of advanced technology, mechas, and an elite military academy at the center of it all.

# The Project

As a UX/UI student and someone passionate about creating immersive experiences, I wanted to make our campaign as fun and interactive as possible. Thatâ€™s how this project was born!

Knights of the Round Academy is a mockup of a military academyâ€™s webpage. It includes:

    * General Lore: Dive into the rich history and world-building that sets the stage for our campaign.
    * Student Profiles: Meet the charactersâ€”both the players and some key NPCsâ€”that make up the academyâ€™s student body.
    * Mecha Info Pages: Explore the specs and backstories of the mechas piloted by our characters.
    * "GRaiL Chatbot" interaction: a chatbot to simulate the AI of the mechas
    * And More: Additional content to bring the world to life!

# Why This Project?

This project is not just a showcase of our campaign but also a way for me to improve my coding skills. While the initial idea was to create a Discord Bot (which turned out to be a bit too ambitious for my current skill level), I decided to start with something I know betterâ€”web design!
Learning and Growing

As much as Iâ€™m excited about sharing this project, Iâ€™m equally eager to learn and improve. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m not allowing forks of this repository. However, I would absolutely love to hear your suggestions, feedback, and ideas on how to make this project even better.

Feel free to open an issue or drop a comment with your thoughts. Your input will help me grow as a developer, and who knows, maybe someday Iâ€™ll be ready to tackle that Discord Bot!
